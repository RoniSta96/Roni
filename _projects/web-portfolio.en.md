# Personal Portfolio Website 

2025
This project showcases my work with a bilingual Jekyll site.  
Features include:
- Language toggle (fi/en)
- Custom theme overrides
- Responsive design

This project started as a need to have one portfolio for all of my different projects. I tried using multiple Portfolio-apps and services but they were all lacking some elements I really needed.

Goal was to create a simple Portfolio page where I could include all my project whether it'd be programming, Figma files, video editing, 3D editing, games etc. I wanted it to be highly customizable and scalable.
