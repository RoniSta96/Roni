# About Me

I graduated from Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied sciences with a Bachelor of engineering in 2022. I majored in health technology. Since then I've been working in Evondos Oy with medicine automation.
In my freetime I carry out lot's of various projects which I plan to update here on this Portfolio page. From webdesign to programming and music to digital art.

Currently I am working on my first large programming project; music social media app in the style of Pinterest. Right now I am working on the Figma designs and at the same time studying user experiences and user interface design. You can follow the process on this page and on Github.

I also play music in addition to web design and programming projects. You can find links to my music projects on the contacts page. I compose, edit music videos, organize social media and marketing, book gigs and so on. 

I've only recently published this Portfolio page so there are bunch of projects and information missing still. You can contact me through the contact page for any questions, improvement suggestions or job offers.
